========================

Just a simple bash script that increases your page views by multiplexing several difference 
technologies in parallel to load your page. Purely for fun.

What you need to run this?
1) lynx - sudo apt-get install lynx ( who needs web browser? )
2) wmctrl - sudo apt-get install wmctrl (for graceful exits :) )
3) firefox - sadly yeah..
4) a bit of patience.
